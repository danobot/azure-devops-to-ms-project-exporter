This script provides a way to use MS Project to do critical path analysis for projects managed in Azure Devops boards (ADO).

In main.py:
* Add your organisation ID and personal access token to code variable
* create a saved query in ADO and paste the query id in code variable

To get the most out of this exporter, you need to populate the following in ADO:
- estimates
- predecessors
- assignees
